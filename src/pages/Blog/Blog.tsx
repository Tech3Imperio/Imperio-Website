            PVB and SGP are interlayers used in laminated glass with distinct
            properties. PVB is cost-effective and commonly used in residential
            and commercial applications but is sensitive to moisture, which can
            cause decay over time. SGP, on the other hand, is more rigid,
            durable, and resistant to moisture, UV rays, and yellowing, making
            it ideal for high-strength applications like glass flooring and
            hurricane-resistant windows. SGP is five times stronger, 100 times
            more rigid, and offers superior edge stability and structural
            performance compared to PVB.
